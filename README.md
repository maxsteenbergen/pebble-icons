# [Pebble](https://pebble.framer.media)
> A free funky formalicious icon set for React (& plain ol' SVG & PNG)

Pebble is an icon set that aims for a friendly character. There's no real demographic, no target use case or application for this set:   
it's mainly intended as a counterpart to all the clean, geometric sets out there. Sometimes, your design could use a little fun(k): that's where Pebble comes in.

## How to use Pebble
Pebble is offered as plain SVG, PNG, or as React components (built with [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/)). Either clone the repo, or install it with Yarn: 

```
yarn add pebble-icons

```

or NPM: 

```
npm install pebble-icons
```

Import your icon(s) of choice, then add them like any other React component. You can add the `color` prop to set your own fill (default white): there's no stroke in any of them.

```
import { Leaf } from "pebble-icons"

<Leaf color={"#f00"} />
```

## What's in it?
There's about 160 icons so far, so to much to list. Look at the grid on the [homepage](https://pebble.framer.media) to find the icon you need.

## Questions / requests?
Just leave an issue on this repo. However, Pebble is just a little thing I did on the side so I'm not making any promises :)
